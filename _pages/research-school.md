As a measure for communication and exploitation, we plan to organize a cross-disciplinary one-week research school for students and researchers during the spring semester of 2028. The course will address the “Solar impact on the winter polar atmosphere – from space to surface,” integrating the latest advancements and results from the STAR project. The school aims to trained a new generation of cross-disciplinary scientists and will serve as a catalyst for collaborative research.
