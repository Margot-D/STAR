Measures for communication and exploitation 

The STAR project aims to produce a minimum of nine peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals, as outlined in Table 1. The fundamental insights anticipated from this research—particularly in WP3—position us to target top-tier interdisciplinary journals such as Science or Nature. To ensure timely communication and feedback, we will present our results at major international conferences, including EGU, AGU, and HEPPA-SOLARIS, engaging both the space and atmospheric science communities. In addition, we will host online seminars specifically for stakeholders to discuss key findings, gather feedback, and incorporate relevant perspectives into the project’s final outputs. 

To complement our academic dissemination efforts, we will also prioritize public engagement and communication. STAR will have its own webpage showcasing key scientific results, with updates and milestones shared via social media platforms such as Instagram and LinkedIn. We will also give public talks and interviews and write popular science reports to communicate our progress and promote broader awareness of the project’s relevance. 

Additionally, we plan to organize a cross-disciplinary one-week research school for students and researchers during the spring semester of 2028. The course will address the “Solar impact on the winter polar atmosphere – from space to surface,” integrating the latest advancements and results from the STAR project. The PM has previously organized similar successful research schools at the University of Bergen (UiB) in 2015, 2017, and 2019. These events not only trained a new generation of cross-disciplinary scientists but also served as catalysts for collaborative research, resulting in two successful project proposals funded by the Research Council of Norway.
